Amazon Distribution Strategy

Amazonâ€™s business model follows both a B2C and B2-B distribution strategy. 
Indeed, on the one hand, its e-commerce platform is consumer-facing, providing millions of products to billions of users around the world. 
At the same time, its e-commerce platform is also used by other businesses, called third-party stores, to sell their own products on top of Amazon.
